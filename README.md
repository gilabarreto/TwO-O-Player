# TwO-O-Player
TwO-O-Player is a math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems.
A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. 
The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

This game was build with Ruby as part of my Lighthouse Labs studies.

Enjoy!
